# Linguistics - Lesson 15 - 2022/12/27

$\t{\Lgs\Lth\Leth\Lsh\Lzh\Lm\Ln\Ldj\LA}$

### Phonological processes, cont.

Differences between morphological processes and ph

* Motivation - word formation

* phonological process - Motivation - pronounciation - can be influenced by morphological processes

$\t{/bank/}$

$\t{[ba\Ln k]}$

$\t{n} \to \t{\Ln}$ before $\t{k}$

This contained only a phonological process, with no morphological process.

seem - talk

past form

si:m-d - $\t{t\LA k-d}$

$\t{[si:md]}$ - $\t{t\LA kt}$

Past morpheme

d after (+voice)

t after (-voice)

We have two options for what the phonological process here can be:

* Option I: /d/ $\to$ [t] after (-voice)
* Option II: /t/ $\to$ [d] after (+voice)

We look for a form with a vowel and see what there is there in order to see which is the default form.

agree+d

carried

d is now after (+voice) and vowels, which maked it seem that t is more specific.

Therefore we will consider the d the general form.

t is more predictable and occurs in only specific known environments

Third person verbs

z after (+voice)

s after (-voice)

The default form is z (elsewhere environment)

* Assimialation

  partial/full

  progressive/regressive

  relevant veature

  * Voicing assimialation

  * place assimialation

  * full assimialtion
    
    a phone becomes identical to an adjacent phone

  * aspiration

  * spiritization

  * paradigm levelling

  arabic:

  il-qamar - the moon

  il-ktaib - the book

  When the word begins with certain consonants

  il-shams

  ish-shams $\t{[i\Lsh -\Lsh ams]}$

  Here there is full assimialtion

  tuit - strawberry

  il-tuit -> ittuit

  In arabic **coronals** have this full assimialation


>  Places of articulation can be devided into a few groups
>
>  * labials
>  * dorsals
>  * coronals

  iltizam does not become ittizam, since the lt sequence is part of the word

  > The phonological process is **conditioned** on the morphological one.

  independant
  
  impolite

  irrelevant

  illegal

  im - before (p,b,m) bilabials

  ir - before r

  il - before l 

  ---

  biʃel - cooked

  yevaʃel - will cook

  piter - fired

  yefater - will fire

  kitev - corresponded

  yexatev - will correspond

  siper - told

  yesaper - will tell

  stop -> fricative after a vowel
  
  * spiritization

2. Deletion

   shalax - he sent

   shalax-ti - I sent

   /shalaxa/ $\to$ [shalxa] - she sent

   /simes+a/ $\to$ [simsa]

   lamad - lakax

   yilmad - /yilkax/ $\to$ [yikax]

3. Insertion/Epenthesis

   need - /ni:d/

   past form

   $\t{/ni:dd/}$ $\to$ $\t{[ni:dId]}$

   $\t{/dd/}$ $\to$ $\t{[dId]}$

   $\t{/td/}$ $\to$ $\t{[tId]}$

4. Metathesis

   xibek hitxabek
 
   risek hitrasek
 
   but
 
   shiper $\not\to$ hitshaper
 
   shiper $\to$ hishtaper
 
   tsh $\to$ sht
