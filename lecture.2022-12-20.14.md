# Linguistics - Lesson 14 - 2022/12/20

$\t{\Lgs\Lth\Leth\Lsh\Lzh\Lm\Ln\Ldj}$

We talked about t

* distinctive features
* phonemes
* allophones

* place of articulation
* voicing (voiced/voiceless)
* manner of articulation

### Manner of articulation

* stop - Air completetely blocked - and then bursts out

* fricatives - Close approximation of the speech organs, and the air flows with friction

  * strident/sibilant - Even greater friction

* affricates - Combination between stop and fricative.
  
  Air completely blocked at the beginning, then gradual release of air

* nasal - Air blocked in the oral cavity, but air flows freely through the nasal cavity

> **approximant** - speach organs get near each other but do not touch
* Approximant - liquids - air flows freely
* Approximant - glide - semi-vowels - air flows freely

  * the difference between these and vowels has to do with position.

---

When we talked about minimal pairs, we provided a limited definition. Let us expand that here:

> **minimal pair** - Difference in: 
> * meaning
> * one phone only
> * one feature only (place of articulation/manner of articulation/voice)

mail /bail/ pail

mail and bail are a minimal pair - difference in manner of articulation

pail and bail are a minimal pair - unvoiced/voiced

mail and pail are **not** a minimal pair - There is a difference in **both** voicing and place of articulation

We also write voiced/unvoiced as +voice/-voice or as voiced/voiceless

---

In most Arabic dialects, we do not have a distinction between p/b or f/v. 

But p can appear as an **allophone** of b. 

smile: ibtisaim -> iptisaim

---

On the assignment we will have words, which we have to show if they are a minimal pair.

We need to transcribe them and show that there is only one difference.

tear / dear

[tir] / [dir]

* t/d
* Distinct meaning
* Same place of articulation (alveolar)
* Same manner of articulation
* -voice/+voice

---

### Vowels

We mostly won't study vowels in this class

They are shown in a special chart

There are many vowels, but in this class we will approximate them with the 5 vowels from english orthography

* There are high vowels / low vowels (tongue on top of mouth vs bottom)
* There are front vowels / back vowels (tongue in front or back of mouth)
* Round vowels - lips are round

French:

* lu [ly]
* loup [lu]

Both round vowels but with one being a front vowel and one being a back vowel

---

phonetic inventory vs ponemic inventory

* phonetic inventory - all the sounds (phones) produced in a given language

* phonemic inventory - all the phonemes in the language (all the sounds that can separate minimal pairs)

In english - $\t{p}$ vs $\t{p}^\t{h}$ are in the phonetic inventory but not in the phonemic inventory. In Hindi on the other hand, they are in both the phonetic and the phonemic inventory.

$\Leth$ is a phoneme in English, but not in Hebrew. 

p is not part of the phonemic inventory of arabic dialects, but is part of the phonetic inventory, as an allophone of b. In loan words it tends to be replaced by the closest phoneme.

**markedness** - 

When we examine the phonetic inventories of different language we see a pattern of markedness

$\t{n} > \Ln$

$\t{m} > \Lm$

With $\Ln$ and $\Lm$ being the marked phonemes.

If the marked version exists, then the tendency is for the unmarked version to exist as well.

---

UR vs PR

UR:

* Phonemes
* distinguish between minimal pairs
* distinctive feature

PR

* Allophones
* Complementary distribution - can never occur in the same phonetic environment

Some phonemes can also be allophones of each other.

dear / tear

* [dir] / [tir]

* +voice / -voice

love / talk

[lav] / [tak]

past form:

loved / talked

/lavd/ [lavd] / /takd/ [takt]

In this case, t is an allophone of d even though they can also be separate phonemes.

There are phonological processes for the gaps between the UR and the PR.

---

### Phonological processes

* Assimialation

  * Two phones become identical in one or more features. 

  $\ur{\t{takd}}$ -> t

  * $\t{k}$ - velar /stop / -voice
  * $\t{d}$ - alveolar /stop / +voice

  When two consonants come togeter, the first consonant *gives* the second one its voice.

  * This is **voicing assimialation**

    It can occur in both direction

    /ibtisaim/ -> [iptisaim]. b -> p. regressive assimialation where the p got lost its voice from the t

    /zaken/ [zaken]

    /zkena/ [zkena] / [skena]. -voiced on the s

    /xishev/ -> /xeshbon/ -> [xezhbon]

    [azhdod]

    sh - palato-alveolar/fricative/-voice
    b - bilabial/stop/+voice
    sh -> zh +voice

  There are three things that need to be checked:

  * Progressive vs regressive
    
    Does the second consonant get its feature from the first or the opposite

  * Relevant feature

    * Place of articulation
    * Manner of articulation
    * partial/full

  In a given language, the direction tends to be consistent, regarding a given feature. 

  In hebrew, regarding voicing, the direction is regressive, while in english it is progressive.

  * **Place Assimialation**

    /simfoni/ -> [si$\Lm$foni]

    * m - bilabial/nasal/+voice
    * f - labio-dental/fricative/-voice
    * $\Lm$ - labio-dental/nasal/+voice

    Place assimialation in english is usually *regressive*.

    In english, place assimialation is particularly common regarding *nasal* consonants.
