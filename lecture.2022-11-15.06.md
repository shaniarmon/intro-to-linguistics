# Linguistics - Lesson 5 - 2022/11/10

### Bundles of features/cluster of properties

> Parameters whose values come together

Pleonastic/expletive pronouns - pronouns with no reference whos job is to fill the subject position in a sentence.

il est arrive un colis
there (be) arrived a parcel

$\bempty$ e arrivato un pacco

Example 2

phrase structure

head complement

verb phrase V = met John

preposition phrase P - to John

The head/complement order tends to be consistent between different phrase
types. But can be different between languages.

Greenberg 1963 Some universes of grammar with...

11 languages have complement and then verb and also have complement and then preposition (head last)

16 out of 19 other languages have head first.

In 3 languages there was a mix of verb/preposition first and the other last.

### Generative linguistics

> A term for chomskys theory

It is also known as **Theoretical linguistics** but some people take issue
with this term.

A model that allows us to describe how to generate any possible sentence, produce them and understand them.

As opposed to **Generative linguistics** we have **Functional linguistics**
which focuses on the *function* of the language. This usually doesn't assume
innateness, and is usually usage-based. 

* John gave books to Mary

* John gave Mary books

There is a difference between order of the complements of the verb, and also regarding the existence of the preposition.

* \* John gave books Mary

*Generative Linguistics* would try to explain why the first two are grammatical and the third isn't, probably using a syntactic tree.

*Functional linguistics* would look at the first two and figure out which is more common and why. And when we would use one over the other.

Another type of linguistics is **Applied linguistics**. It takes linguistic theories, from both Generative and Functional linguistics and studies how it can be used in everyday life. In computation, socially, Linguistic planning, etc...

### Morphology

> Study of word structure, formation, decomposition

Unlike sentences, we can talk about a limited set of words at a given time, our vocabulary, but this is constantly getting expanded.

hebrew:

mtuxbac - מתוכבץ

taxbac

taxbura ciburit

public transportation

mtuxbac - מתוכבץ

An area accessible to public transportation

Based on the formations mefursam, melumad,...

korona -> adjectivisation koroni, koronati, mekuran, koronai

# What is a word?

I fell asleep

Nirdamti

The book

Hasefer

West Greenlandic: Single word

tusa: - nngit - su           - nsair   - tuainnar   - sinna: - nngi - vip - putit

hear  - no    - intransitive - pretend - allthetime - can    - negation - really - 2nd personn singular

You can't pretend not to hear me all the time

> **Word**: 
> * phonological definition - separate words by sound
> * Semantic  definition - separate words by meaning
> * Grammatical definition - book, books, singular fish, plural fish
> * lexical definition - Everything written seperately in the lexicon

There are many *conflicting* definitions regarding what is a wors, so we will not define it here.

> **Morpheme** The minimal linguistic unit that carries meaning or grammatical function.

successfully success-ful-ly - three morphemes, with each contributing to the meaning of the word.

Base - success

We make a distinction between *free morphemes* and *bound morphemes*

> **Free morpheme** - can stand on its own

> **Bound morpheme** - cannot stand on its own, attached to other morphemes

played play-ed

> **Stem** The base to which we add morphemes (play)

> **Affixes** The bound morphemes that are added to stems (ed), suffix, prefix, infix

Suffixes - -ment -s -tion

Prefix - pre- 

Infix: abso*fucking*lutely

$\boxed{\text{Ulwa}}$ 

ana:laika - chin

ana:kalaika - his chin

karasmak - knee

karaskamak - his nee

infix: -ka- placed after the first two syllables in the middle of the word

Loan words are very helpful for the study of the language, because it shows how the processes *currently* work.

Wehen we examine the distribution of the different kinds of affixes across languages we find the following heierarchy:

suffix > prefix > infix

markedness

marked vs unmarked

The rare, special cases are *marked*. They are rare, special and often acquired late. 

The unmarked case is th e usual case within a language.

The occurence of the marked element indicates the occurence of the less marked case.
