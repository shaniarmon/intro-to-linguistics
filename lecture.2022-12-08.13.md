# Linguistics - Lesson 13 - 2022/12/08

$\t{\Lgs\Lth\Leth\Lsh\Lzh\Lm\Ln\Ldj}$

Basic terms in phonetics and phonology:

* phone
* phoneme
* minimal pair

$\t{symptom}$ vs $\t{sy\Lm phony}$

When would we use $\t{m}$ vs $\t{\Lm}$?

$\t{m}$

* At the beginning of the word
* between vowels
* between e and p
* between o and t

$\t{\Lm}$

* before f or v

$\t{m} \to \t{\Lm}$ before f or v

$\t{m}$ is the phoneme, with the allophones $\t{m}$ and $\t{\Lm}$

Phonemes are about **perception**. If the sound, sounds the same, then it is the same phoneme. The allophone is about **production**, where in the mouth it is produced and how.

Underlying representation, UR - Marked with $\ur{}$

Phonetic representation, PR, (Surface representation) - Marked with $\t{[]}$

$\ur{\t{m}} \to \pr{\t{m}}$

$\ur{\Lm} \to \pr{\t{m}}$

spy pie

$\tub{spay}{unaspirated p}$ vs $\tub{pay}{aspirated}$ - The two $p$s are not in the same environment.

unaspirated $p$

* predict
* split
* spay
* spirit
* prey
* stop
* plight

aspirated p:

* part
* peace
* pie
* polite
* pot
* pink

The aspirated p appears in the following places:

* At the beginning of the word + before a vowel

The assumption is that $\ur{p}$ is the phoneme, with the following tho allophones:

* $\pr{\t{p}}$ - unaspirated form
* $\pr{\t{p}^\t{h}}$ - aspirated form

In english, the aspiration does not change the meaning of the word. By contrast, in Hindi, aspiration is a **distinctive feature** that can be responsible for different meaning of a word, so there the aspirated form would be considered a phoneme of its own.

UR

* phonemes
* distinctive features

PR

* allophone
* complementary distribution - The two phones will never occur in the same environment

phones $\neq$ letters.

We need a system where there will be a unique mapping between phones and symbols.

k sound in english: k, c, q, ch, ck

how many sounds does s represent? s as in sing, z as in please, sh as in sure

There are multiple different systems to represent this mapping

* IPA - International Phonetic Alphabet
* APA - American Phonetic Alphabet

hebrew dog: kelev

climbs - $\ur{\t{klaimz}}$

knight - $\ur{\t{nait}}$

With vowel
