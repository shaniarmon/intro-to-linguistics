# Introduction to Linguistics

## Assignment 5

> **A** Examine the following words:
>
> *inaccurately, bravery,  painters, deactivating*
>
> 1. Divide the following English words into morphemes. Indicate the stem(s), root and suffixes/prefixes (there could be more than one option).
>
> 2. Indicate for **$\tsfu{each}$** affix whether it is inflectional or derivational. **$\tsfu{Explain your decision using the relevant criteria}$** (there could be more than one option).

* $\t{inaccurately}$

  $\stem{\prefix{in}\root{accurate}}\suffix{ly}$

  * root: $\t{accurate}$
  * prefix: $\t{in-}$
    
    This is a derivational affix

    * Change of meaning (Adjective $\to$ Adjective of opposite meaning)
    * Restricted productivity

      $\t{thirsty \(\to\) *inthirsty}$

  * suffix: $\t{-ly}$

    This is a derivational affix
    * Change of lexical category (Adjective $\to$ Adverb)
    * Change of meaning (inaccurate $\to$ To do with inaccuracy)
    * Restricted productivity

      $\t{big \(\to\) *bigly}$

  * stem: $\t{inaccurate}$

* $\t{bravery}$

  $\root{brave}\suffix{-ry}$

  * root: $\t{brave}$
  * suffix: $\t{-ry}$

    This is a derivational affix
    * Change of lexical category (Adjective $\to$ Noun)
    * Low productivity

      $\bd{strong}{strongery}$

* $\t{painters}$

  $\stem{\root{paint}\suffix{er}}\suffix{s}$

  * root: $\t{paint}$
  * suffix: $\t{-er}$

    This affix is derivational

    * Change of meaning

      Person who paints (job)

    * Limited tranparency

      When $\t{-er}$ is on some nouns, it can mean "place of-", or "machine that does -"

      $\t{printer}$ - Place of printing
      
      $\t{computer}$ - Device that computes (Although this was originally a job)

    * Limited productivity

      $\bd{keyboard}{keyboarder}$

  * suffix: $\t{-s}$

    This affix is inflectional

    * Same lexical category (Noun)

    * Change of grammatical category 
    
      number: Noun $\to$ Plural Noun

    * Highly productive

    * High transparency - When $\t{-s}$ is assed to a noun, it makes it plural

  * stem: $\t{painter}$

* $\t{deactivating}$

  $\stem{\prefix{de}\stem{\root{activ}{\suffix{at}}}}\suffix{ing}$

  * root: $\t{active}$

    I considered spliting this into "act" and "ive", but I really don't think about this word that way.

  * prefix: $\t{de-}$

    This affix is derivational

    * Change of meaning (Verb $\to$ Opposite Verb)
    * Limited productivity

      $\bd{kill}{dekill}$
  * suffix: $\t{-at}$
    
    This affix is derivational

    * Change of lexical category (Adjective $\to$ Verb)
    * Change of meaning (Active $\to$ To make Active)

    * Limited productivity

      $\bd{small}{smallate}$

  * suffix: $\t{-ing}$

    This affix can be inflectional or derivational

    inflectional:

    * Change of grammatical category

      tense: Present progressive

    * Transparent meaning

    * Highly productive

    derivational:

    * Change of lexical category (Verb $\to$ Noun (gerund form))

  * stem 1: $\t{activate}$
  * stem 1: $\t{deactivate}$

> **B**
> Examine the following sets of data (relate to the process in each column separately in case it is relevant). For each set of data:
>
> 1.  provide the name of the morphological process that takes place and explain it shortly
> 2.  Is this process derivational or inflectional? Explain.
>
> **$\tsfu{Tagalog}$ $\tsf{(there are two different processes, relate the second and third columns separately)}$**
> ```
> basa	‘read’ 		bumasa     ‘Read!’   	babasa		‘will read’ 
> tawag	‘call’   	tumawag    ‘Call!’   	tatawag	    ‘will call’
> ```
>
> **$\tsfu{Rendille}$** (Kenya)
>
> ```
> ínam  ‘boy’        inám     ‘girl’
> áram  ‘husband’    arám     ‘wife’
> ```

* For the **Tagalog** data:

  In the first column, we have an **infix affix**. After the frst consonant we add $\t{-um-}$. I would consider this inflectional (Command verb, Same lexical category).

  In the second column we have an example of **reduplication** where the first syllable is duplicated in the word. This too I would consider inflectional (Future tense, Same lexical category)

* For the **Rendille** data, we have an example of **stress shift**. The stress in the masculine forms are on the first vowel, and in the feminine forms on the second vowel. This too I would consider *inflectional* as it changes the gender of the Noun.
