1. $\t{bat - mat}$

   $\t{[bat] - [mat]}$ are a minimal pair. There is a difference of one consonant, with only one feature being different.

   (i) Place of articulation - both $\t{b}$ and $\t{m}$ are bilabial

   (ii) Manner of articulation - $\t{b}$ is a stop and $\t{m}$ is a fricative

   (iii) Voicing - both $\t{b}$ and $\t{m}$ are voiced

2. bake - cake

   $\t{[beik] - [keik]}$ are not a minimal pair. There is a difference in one consonant, but in more than one feature.

   (i) Place of articulation - $\t{b}$ is bilabial and $\t{k}$ is velar

   (ii) Manner of articulation - both $\t{b}$ and $\t{k}$ are stops

   (iii) Voicing - $\t{b}$ is voiced and $\t{k}$ is voiceless

3. pink – sink

   $\t{[pi\Ln k] - [si\Ln k]}$ are not a minimal pair. There is a difference in one consonant, but in more than one feature.

   (i) Place of articulation - $\t{p}$ is bilabial and $\t{s}$ is alveolar

   (ii) Manner of articulation - $\t{p}$ is a stop and $\t{s}$ is a fricative

   (iii) Voicing - both $\t{p}$ and $\t{s}$ are voiceless

4. right - write

   $\t{[rait] - [rait]}$ are not a minimal pair, since there is no difference in phonemes. They are the same word.

5. pray - stay

   $\t{[prei] - [stei]}$ are not a minimal pair. There is a difference in more than one consonant. ($\t{p}\to\t{s}$ and $\t{r}\to\t{t}$)

6. main - male

   $\t{[mein] - [mal]}$ are not a minimal pair. There is a difference in both a vowel and a consonant.
