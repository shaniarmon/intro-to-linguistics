> **A** For each of the following sentences, decide whether it is true or false
> and explain your decision in 1-2 sentences. *Your explanation should include the
> relevant terms used in class*.

1. The terms 'competence' and 'langue' are synonyms.

   **False** Competence refers to what we know about language as *individuals*. 
   Langue refers to what we know about language as a *society*.

2. A language that has expletive pronouns does not allow an empty subject position.

   **True** The parameters "There are expletive pronouns" and "It is possible to
   have an empty subject position" are a *Bundle of Parameters*. There is a tendency
   for them to appear together with the first implying the second.

3. The English pronoun it can only be used as an expletive pronoun.

   **False** "It" can refer to inanimate objects. For example: "The table is blue,
   and it is also tall" with "it" referring to "the table".

4. Both principles and parameters are innate according to Chomsky’s theory.

   **True** With principle being *universal*, and parameters valued being filled out
   during language acquisition of a specific *particular grammar*.

> **B** Choose two languages that you know and explain two grammatical differences
> between them. Phrase the differences as if they were parameters. Provide examples.
> 
> $\underline{\t{Example:}}$ word order - the adjective follows the noun $\uempty$.

> The “value” would be “yes” in Hebrew and “no” in English (compare
> *sipurim arukim* and *long stories*).

* Nouns are gendered.

  The value would be "yes" in Hebrew and "no" in English. For example:
  in hebrew *rexev*, car, is masculine and would use the masculine adjective *gadol* to describe it, while *even*, rock, is feminine and would use the feminine adjective *gdola* to describe i`t. In English, those previous examples would not be gendered, and the neutral pronoun (that doesn't refer to people), it, would be used to refer to them. 

* Verbs acquire quantity depending on the quantity of what they are describing

  The value would be "yes" in Hebrew and "no" in English. "Hen baot" - They are coming(feminine) vs "hee baa" - She is coming. In English we used the same word "coming" for both.
