# Linguistics - Assignment 8 - 2023/01/12


> **Part A**
>
> For each of the following sentences, decide whether it is true or false and explain your decision in <u>1-2 sentences</u>. <u>Your explanation should include the relevant terms used in class</u>.

> 1. A language with VCC syllables definitely has CVC syllables.

**True** Both having a complex coda and not having an onset are marked. We then need to check if they are part of the same hierarchy.

The existence of VCC implies the existence of VC, The same form without the complex coda.

The existence of VC implies the existence of CVC, the form that does have an onset.

> 2. Each of the following words consists of both complex onset and complex coda: *knives*, *cream*,  *trust*.

**False** 

$\t{[naɪvz]}$ - Has only a complex coda, no complex onset (the form CVCC)

$\t{[kri:m]}$ - Has only a complex onset (the form CCVC)

$\t{[t\Lsh\tie}\t{rʌst]}$ - Has both a complex coda and a complex offset (the form CCVCC)

> 3. The morpheme boundary and syllable boundary are the same in the word attachment.

**True** I am assuming the question is referring to the boundary between the second and third syllable. In $\t{[əˈtatʃ\tie .mənt]}$ The syllable $\t{mənt}$ is also the suffix, and the syllable boundary passes before the m.

> 4. There could be a signified without a reference.

**True** It is debatable, of course, but ideas relating to abstract concepts, like emotions, or metaphors, have no objects that they can describe properties of.

> 5. English does not allow codas with three consonants.

**False** Example: burst, or burnt

> **Part B**
>
> For each of the following sentence-pairs, decide whether (b) is an entailment of (a). If (b) is not an entailment of (a), explain why shortly (there is no need to explain anything if (b) is entailed from (a)). You have to assume that sentences (a) are true.

> 1. a) Dan saw the movie at least twice.
>
>    b) Dan saw the movie three times.

(b) is **not** an entailment of (a). Dan may have seen the mobie exactly twice.

> 2. a) The children found out that John had eaten the cake.
>
>    b) John ate the cake.

(b) is an entailment of (a).

> 3. a) If Mary gets a scholarship, she will be able to graduate.
>
>    b) If Mary doesn’t get a scholarship, she won’t be able to graduate.

(b) is **not** an entailment of (a). Mary may be able to graduate without a scholarship.

> 4. a) John and Mary are married.
>
>    b) John is Mary’s husband.

(b) is **not** an entailment of (a). John may be a woman and Mary's wife.

> **Part C**

> 1. Is there a violation of the cooperation principle in the following conversation? If so, point out which maxim is violated and what is the implicature that is drawn. Explain shortly.
>
>    A: I think we should by a new car.
>
>    B: and I think it’s cold today.

**Yes**. The maxim of *relevance* is being violated. The implicature is that B doesn't want to buy / discuss buying a new car.

> 2. Which implicature can be drawn from the B’s answer in the following conversation? Explain.
>
>    A: Did you get the milk and the eggs I asked?
>
>    B: I got the eggs.

The implicature is that B did not buy the milk. If B had bought both the milk and the eggs, they would simply have said "yes". This would be a form of **scalar implicature**, where the weaker statement given implies the stronger statement is false.
