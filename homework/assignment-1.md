# Introduction to Linguistics

## Assignment 1

> **A** For each of the following sentences, decide whether it is true or false and
  explain your decision in 1-2 sentences. Your explanation should include the relevant
  terms used in class.

1. The written language is the empirical basis for research in Modern Linguistics.

   **False** Modern linguistics focuses primarily on spoken language, although not
   necessarily auditory language, as sign language is also included.

2. Traditional Linguistics determines normative rules for using a language.

   **True** Traditional linguistics takes a *prescriptive* aproach to linguistics and
   defines rules for how language should be used.

3. Every native speaker can speak, read, write and curse in his/her mother tongue.

   **False** Illiterate people also have a native tongue. Reading (and cursing) are
   not requirements.

4. The origin of words is not part of the language faculty.

   **True** Language faculty is what we know when we **know** a language. The origin of the words are external to that knowledge and may be studied as part of **historical linguistics** but are not directly linked to knowledge of a language.

5. Phonetics is a field that examines only the way linguistic sounds are produced.

   **False** In phonetics we study how sounds are *produced* and *perceived*.

> **B** Choose two linguistic phenomena. Describe them shortly (4-5 sentences),
  provide examples  and determine to which field(s) they belong (they could be related
  to more than one field).

1. **Denominalization** - Turning nouns into verbs. This can be done using the noun 
   unchanged as a verb, as with "Let us *workshop* this idea", or with adding a prefix
   or suffix, as in "Lets *verbify* these nouns". This is very common in Modern
   Hebrew, with words like לסמס or סימסתי for sending an instant message, or שפעול for
   turning nouns into verbs. This *verbification* is definitely part of the study of
   **morphology** as it has to do with word formation, and is not detached from the meaning of the word, so also would be studied in **semantics**.

2. **Code mixing** - Using constructs from one language when speaking another. This is
   common during the language development of bilingual children. This can be expressed
   using a word from another language in a sentence, such as "Who did you vote for in
   the *bechirot* last Tuesday?". It can alternatively be expressed as grammar from
   another language, as in "Look at that car purple", when in Hebrew the descriptive
   color would come after the noun, while in English it comes before. This would be
   studied as part of **language acquisition**.
