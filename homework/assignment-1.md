# Introduction to Linguistics

## Assignment 1

> **A** For each of the following sentences, decide whether it is true or false and
  explain your decision in 1-2 sentences. Your explanation should include the relevant
  terms used in class.

1. The written language is the empirical basis for research in Modern Linguistics.

   **False** Modern linguistics focuses primarily on spoken language, although not
   necessarily auditory language, as sign language is also included.

2. Traditional Linguistics determines normative rules for using a language.

   **True** Traditional linguistics takes a *prescriptive* aproach to linguistics and
   defines rules for how language should be used.

3. Every native speaker can speak, read, write and curse in his/her mother tongue.

   **False** Illiterate people also have a native tongue. Reading (and cursing) are
   not requirements.

4. The origin of words is not part of the language faculty.

   **True** In human language words are *arbitrary* and do not have a natural meaning
   or origin.

5. Phonetics is a field that examines only the way linguistic sounds are produced.

   **True** In phonetics we study how sounds are *produced* and *perceived*.

> **B** Choose two linguistic phenomena. Describe them shortly (4-5 sentences),
  provide examples  and determine to which field(s) they belong (they could be related
  to more than one field).

1. **Denominalization** - Turning nouns into verbs. This can be done using the noun 
   unchanged as a verb, as with "Let us *workshop* this idea", or with adding a prefix
   or suffix, as in "Lets *verbify* these nouns". This is very common in Modern
   Hebrew, with words like לסמס or סימסתי for sending an instant message, or שפעול for
   turning nouns into verbs. This *verbification* is definitely part of the study of
   **morphology** as it has to do with word formation, and is not detached from the meaning of the word, so also would be studied in **semantics**.
