# Linguistics - Assignment 7 - 2022/12/29
 
> **Part A**
> Explain the phonological processes that took place in the following words (there could also be
> more than one process or no process at all).
> 
> **Example:**
>
> taxed
>
> UR: $\ur{\t{taks-d}}$
>
> PR: $\pr{\t{tʰakst}}$
>
> a. **aspiration**: $\t{t}$ is aspirated at the beginning of the word and before a vowel.
>
> b. **voicing assimilation**: $\t{d}$ becomes [-voice] after a [-voice] consonant.
>
> 1. liked
> 2. mango
> 3. preferred
> 4. pushed
> 5. emphasized
> 6. talented

1. liked
   
   UR: $\ur{\t{laikd}}$

   PR: $\pr{\t{laikt}}$

   a. **voicing assimilation**: $\t{d}$ becomes [-voice] after a [-voice] consonant.

2. mango

   UR: $\ur{\t{meingo}}$

   PR: $\pr{\t{mei\Ln go}}$

   a. **place assimilation**: $\t{n}$ becomes $\t{\Ln}$ before a velar stop ($\t{k}$ or $\t{g}$)

3. preferred

   UR: $\ur{\t{prifer-d}}$

   PR: $\pr{\t{priferd}}$

   I don't see a phonological process in this case

4. pushed

   UR: $\ur{\t{pu\Lsh-d}}$

   PR: $\pr{\t{p\Lasp u\Lsh t}}$

   a. **aspiration**: $\t{p}$ is aspirated at the beginning of the word and before a vowel.

   b. **voicing assimilation**: $\t{d}$ becomes [-voice] after a [-voice] consonant.

5. emphasized

   UR: $\ur{\t{emfasaiz-d}}$

   PR: $\pr{\t{e\Lm fasaizd}}$

   a. **place assimilation**: $\t{m}$ becomes $\t{\Lm}$ before f or v.

6. talented

   UR: $\ur{\t{talent-d}}$

   PR: $\pr{\t{t\Lasp alent\Lasp id}}$

   a. **aspiration**: $\t{t}$ is aspirated at the beginning of the word and before a vowel (twice).

   b. **insertion (or epenthesis)**: the vowel $\t{i}$ is inserted between $\t{t}$ and $\t{d}$

> Part B
> Examine the following data in Hanunuoo (Philippines).

> 
> a. What are the affixes in columns B and C?

In column B the affix is $\t{ka-}$, while in column C the affixes are
$\t{-hi}$, and $\t{-i}.

> b. There are two phonological processes that apply in column B. Provide the name of the processes
and explain them.

The two processes are **deletion** and **metathesis**.

When the first vowel of the stem is a $\t{u}$, it is deleted.

When the first consonant is $\t{\Lgs}$, then the first two consonants switch places.

> c. What is the phonological process that applies in column C? Provide the name of the process and
explain it (there are two options).

I would say that the process that applies is either **full assimilation** or **deletion**.

For the case of full assimilation, when the stem ends in a consonant, the $\t{h}$ becomes that same consonant.

For the case of deletion, when the stem ends in a consonant, the $\t{h}$ is deleted.
