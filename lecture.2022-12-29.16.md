# Linguistics - Lesson 15 - 2022/12/27

$\t{\Lgs\Lth\Leth\Lsh\Lzh\Lm\Ln\Ldj\LA}$

Phonological processes - summary

* Assimialation (place/voicing/full)
* Deletion
* Insertion/epenthesis
* Metathesis


When analysing phonological processes, we have to as kthree questions:

* What hapens?
* In which environment?
* Why?


---

Metathesis

hitraxec - wash oneself

hitCaCeC

When the first consonant is $\t{s,\Lsh,z,c,\Lzh,ts\tie}$ the t and the consonant switch places.

histaper

Only happens in the form hitCaCeC - very dependent on morphology

hitsis - *histis

Also happens in new words

histames - *hitsames

---

delete - /dilit-d/ - [dilited]

Many languages tend to avoid sequences of phoned that are very similiar - /dd/ /td/

In hebrew we have something similiar, but it competes with another process:

kalat - absorb

/kalat-ti/ - I absorbed

We have a variation between two possible PRs

[kalati] or [kalateti]

In the first case there is consonant deletion, in the other there is vowel insertion.

Both strategies have the same goal, to avoid two similiar consonants next to each other.

$\ur{\Lsh adad-ti}$ - $\pr{\Lsh adadeti}$ or $\pr{\Lsh adati}$ 

$\ur{hitdayen}$ - $\pr{hidayen}$

$\ur{hitzaken}$ - $\pr{hizdaken}$

First **regressive** voicing assimialation and **then** metathesis.

The order of the rules is important.

It seems here that there is **progressive** voicing assimialation in Hebrew, where it is regressive.

sde-teufa -> zde-teufa

hitzaken -> hidzaken -> hizdaken

--

In arabin we have a pharyngeal stop $\t{ʡ}$ (ע) in addition to the glottal stop $\t{\Lgs}$ - which is no longer pronounced in hebrew.

There is a similiar difference between t and t^ʡ^

Similiaf to the hebrew hitCaCeC, there is the arabic iCtaCaC

ibtasam - smile

$\t{/is}^{\t{ʡ}}\t{tadam/}$ - the t gets progressive assimialation of pharyngeality and becomes $\t{[is}^{\t{ʡ}}\t{t}^{\t{ʡ}}\t{adam]}$

In hebrew historically $\ur{hitsadek}$ - $\pr{histadek}$ too would hava had the pharyngeality on both the s and the t.

---

Morphological processes are motivated by meaning. Phonological processes are motivated by pronounciation. 

A similiar process can be responsible for either morphological processes or phonological processes. But in the case of morphological processes, they will be accompanied by a change in meaning.

---

### The syllable

The syllable is a phonolical constituent. 

The assumption is that words are divided into syllables (are perceived in syllables)

bIli:v - Beleive - be-liv - two syllables

contemporary - con-tem-po-ra-ry - 5 syllables

We don't hear syllables - we hear consonants and words. Syllables are a theoretical term, that the evidence for is based on psycho linguistics experiments and language acquisition.

Syllables are a phonological component, not a morphological component.

$\pr{\Lsh ar}$ - he sang

$\pr{\Lsh ara}$ - she sang

$\pr{\Lsh arnu}$ - we sang

We mark a syllable boundary with a dot vs the dash  the with morphological boundary.

$\pr{\Lsh a.r-a}$ - she sang

$\pr{\Lsh ar.-nu}$ - we sang

We notice that the syllable boundary changed.

The number of syllabled and the number of morphemes does not have to be the same

$\pr{katavnu}$ - we wrote

$\pr{ka.tav.-nu}$ - we wrote

---

the syllable is composed of the following elements:

* C - onset - a Consonant that occurs before the nucleus
* V - the nucleus - The core of the syllable, a vowel
* C - coda - a consonant that occurs after the vowel

tell - $\pr{tel}$ - CVC

be - $\pr{bi:}$ - CV

free - $\pr{fri:}$ - CCV - complex onset

plans - $\pr{planz}$ - CCVCC - Complex onset and complex coda

The nucleus can be complex as well, known as a dipthong or a long vowel

like - $\pr{laIk}$ - dipthong

There are different types of combinations of syllables.

CV is the most unmarked syllable, and all languages have it.

Types of syllables are organised in a heierarchy of markedness.

CV >> V

CV >> CCV >> CCCV

Having a coda is also marked

CV >> CVC >> CVCC

in english we have many forms

text $\pr{tekst}$ - CVCCC

---

Syllable stress

marked before the syllable

tissue - $\pr{ti\' \Lsh u}$

In a multiple syllable word there may be more than one syllable that is stressed (but less than the stressed syllable. It is markd with a symbol on the bottom before the syllable)

california $\pr{ˌkaliˈfornIa}$

There is one primary stree but there can be multiple secondary stress
