3 | gender : semantic gender / grammatical gender / morphological marking:
semantic gender (biological): regarding our word knowledge (husband, wife). relates only to animate nouns.
grammatical gender: relatively arbitrary - relates to the language grammatical agreement. By default loan words are unmarked (the unmarked form is maculine in Hebrew, although there are exceptions).
morphological marking can relate to both semantic & grammatical genders:
Does the language mark semantic gender, morphologically? 
(e.g. actor-actress; tamaguta; feminine form suffixes)
Grammatical genders are determined by forms (in languages where the concept persists). â†’ loan words that end with â€˜aâ€™ tend to be treated as feminine in Hebrew since it sounds similar to the feminine form (the morphological marking that relates to that concept) in Hebrew.
4 | case : marks syntactic position (he/him, who/whom; the subject, direct / indirect position) - â€˜waladâ€™ = boy: â€˜al-waladuâ€™, â€˜al-waladaâ€™, â€˜al-waladiâ€™).

verb
5 | tense : the time that the verb denotes. 
6 | aspect : additional properties (time related) to tense. e.g:
(tense) progressive, (aspect) perfective = the action is complete / imperfective = the action is in progress or will take place.
7 | modality : the speaker's attitude towards the action (politeness, imperative).

adj
8 | comparatives, superlatives.

Distinction:
1 | Change in: [derivation] meaning. Creates a new lexical entry.
[inflection] no drastic change in meaning, but in grammatical features (gender, tenseâ€¦)

2 | Change in Lexical Category: [derivation] possible change. 
[inflection] NO change.

3 | Relevancy to Syntax: [derivation] irrelevant.
[inflection] can be relevant.
ha-yeled h-xadaÅ¡ nixnas / ha-yalda ha-xadaÅ¡a nixnesa: since we changed the gender of the kid we had to inflect the adj and the verb: syntactic correction.
*ha-yaldon (diminutive form of ha-yeled) ha-xadaÅ¡on nixnason: the change is irrelevant to the syntax (in Hebrew. In some languages a similar change might be relevant to the syntax, which would indicate an inflectional change). 
p.s. â€˜yaldiâ€™ doesnâ€™t affect the syntax but that doesnâ€™t mean that itâ€™s not an inflection.

4 | Productivity: [derivation] restricted.
[inflection] relatively high productivity (e.g. [-ed] past tense, [-s] plural form).
soft â†’ soften / sharp â†’ sharpen / red â†’ redden: the productivity is relatively low since we canâ€™t apply [-en] to every adj: big â†’ *biggen / yellow â†’ *yellowen: potentially correct, but donâ€™t exist. This indicates a gap. 
In order to define productivity we have to examine the input & outputs that are possible, and the potential gaps that may form. Gaps denote derivation.

5 | Transparency (predictability): [derivation] relatively low (less obvious meaning).
[inflection] high transparency.
To what extent can we predict the meaning of a new word?
Sometimes the same process (of derivation) gets different results. 
take a verb and add to it the suffix [-er]: (work â†’ worker / fight â†’ fighter) = the result is an agent noun = occupation, some sort of profession. BUT, it might also indicate machines and instruments (scan â†’ scanner / print â†’ printer). Two possible outputs = Two functions of the same rule = lower transparency.
