# Linguistics - Lesson 8 - 2022/11/22

$\t{reconsiderations}$

$\prefix{re}\root{consider}\suffix{ation}\suffix{s}$

root: consider

prefix: re-

suffix: -ation

suffix: -s

* re-:
  
  input: Verb
  
  output: Verb

* -ation:

  input: Verb

  output: Noun

* -s

  input: Noun

  output: Plural noun

$\stem{\stem{\prefix{re}\root{consider}}\suffix{ation}}\suffix{s}$

stem 1: reconsider

stem 2: reconsideration

word: reconsiderations

$\t{unexpectedly}$

$\prefix{un}\root{expect}\suffix{ed}\suffix{ly}$

* un-:

  input: Adjective

  Output: Adjective - opposite meaning

* un-:

  input: Verb

  output: Verb (to do the reverse)

The second meaning of "un-" does not work with every verb. "unexpect" is not a word.

> **stem 1**: expected

* -ed
 
  two possible derivations

  input: Verb

  output: Verb (past tense)

  input: Verb

  output: Adjective

The second rule of -ed is applicable here

* -ly
  
  input: Adjective

  output: Adverb

Can un- be added to adverbs?

We have two options:

option 1:
> **stem 2**: unexpected
>
> **word**: unexpectedly

option 2:
> **stem 2**: expectedly
>
> **word**: unexpectedly

un- doesn't really work well with adverbs, so for our deconstruction we will go with
the first option


option 1:
> **stem 2**: unexpected
>
> **word**: unexpectedly

$\stem{\prefix{un}\stem{\root{expect}\suffix{ed}}}\suffix{ly}$


Some affixes are ambiguous and can be used for multiple functions, like "ed"

Hebrew:

-i

sod "secret"

sodi - my secret (Noun)

sodi - confidential (Adj)

English:

$\tbox{-ing}$

fascinating - 

Adjective - this lesson is fascinating

Verb - I am fascinating you right now

eating

Verb - I am eating

Noun - Eating apples is healthy

---

Sometimes the stem gets modified along the way

long - length

Hebrew:

katav - ti - first person

siper - ti -> siparti -> 

Arabic:

saiken "live"

saiken - e -> saikne

derivation (Derivational (גזירה) morphology/affixes) | inflection( Inflectional (נתייה) morphology/affixes)
- | -
happy - unhappy| swim - swims
farm - farmer | cat - cats
play - player | play - played
attract - attractive | cheap - cheaper
treat - mistreat | katav - katavti
demostrate - demonstration | arnak - arnakex
- | diber - yedaber
- | xadash - xadasha

### Grammatical categories

1. number: singular/plural/(dual)

   the dual form exists in hebrew but is limited. In arabic it is productive:

   arabic - 

   daftar notebook

   dafaiter notebooks

   daftaren two notebooks

   "-en" can be added to any noun in arabic to create a pair

2. person: 1/2/3

3. gender: 

   * semantic(biological) gender - animate nouns

   * grammatical gender - inanimate nouns

     hebrew:

     daf - page - masculine

     kaf - spoon - feminine

     diffrentiate by adjective - xadash/xadasha

     this is **grammatical agreement**. The adjective *agrees* with the gender of the noun. This is arbitrary.

   * morphological marking
