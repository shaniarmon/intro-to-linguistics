# Linguistics - Lesson 5 - 2022/11/10

De Saussure - The father of modern linguistics

He coined the terms *Langue* and *Parole*

* Langue

  The system of rules of language agreed upon by the community

  Nonverbal agreement

  Social term

  What society as a whole, agrees is proper language

  Something abstract we share

* Parole

  Everything we produce, anything we write or say.

  Including errors:

  I read th-th-th-the book

  Gives insight into the Langue

Chomsky coined two other terms, partially parallel to Langue and Parole.

Competence vs Performance

* Competence

  Rules

  Our infinite ability to produce and understand a language

  Abstract knowledge

  The collection of all rules of any language

  Langue is a social term, relating to society as a whole. Competence is an individual term relating to an indivisuals capability and understanding of the language.

  Infinite - as an example recursion which allows us to produce any sentence

  Can teach us about the performance

* Performance - Just like Parole

  Finite - We can't produce all sentences in a lifetime

  can give us an indication of competence

As linguists, we are interested in studying the *competence*.

How can we learn about the competence?

* We can observe the *performance* - although this is very limited

* Experiments

Chomsky claims we are not *Tabula Rassa* when we come to the world. He claims we come to the world with a *Universal grammar* UG that speakers of all languages share.

One the critical period is over and the language acquisition is competes we have *Particular Grammar* PG or just G, the specific grammar of the language we speak. 

The specifig G need to be mapped on the UG and then the PG is established.

Different Grammars are termed G~1~, G~2~, ...

UG + exposure -> G


L~1~ Mothertongue

L~2~ 


Chomsky proposed Principles and Parameters.

* Components of UG

* Both types of rules

Principles are like felafel. All felafel are the same in all languages.

Parameters are like Burekas. All burekas have a different filling in different languages.

> Principles - Closed grammatical rules shared by all languages - no variation

Verbs & nouns - part of speech that are assumed to be shared by all languages.

Adjectives & propositions - some languages do not have these

Verbs - * John improvement his grade last week. In order for this sentence to be valid this sentence needs a verb - improved - but is understood even without it.

Nouns - She said Mary will be late - she $\neq$ Mary.

The boy from london is tall

\* From where the boy is tall?

The boy from london is tall

\* From where the boy is tall?

> Parameters - General rules with differences acquired during language acquisition

Realization of subject position

In some languages the subject positio must be phonetically realized and in some not.

* Parameter: The subject position must be phonetically realized
 
  Value: Yes/No

Rules that are open - but have some innate slot that needs to be filled.

\* have eaten an apple

French: \* ai mange un pomme

Italian: ho mungiato la mela

Hebrew: axalti tapuax

Arabic: akelet tuffaiha


* *Expletive Pronouns* or *Pleonastic pronouns* - Dummy pronouns - They fill the subject position

It Snows

It is raining

It seems that Mary is late

There arrived a package

There was a cat in the house

Unlike *Referential Pronouns*:

*It* is interesting

I saw him *there*

* Parameter: A language has *expletive pronouns*
  
  Value: yes/no

Research has shown there is a correlation between the two parameters

* If a language necessitates filling the subject position, then it also has *expletive pronouns*.

English: It is cold
French: Il fait fraid - literally: it make cold

Italian: fa fredo - No expletive pronoun, the subject position is empty

Chomsky termed these *bundle of feature* or *cluster of properties*. This means parameters can come in connected groups, where you can tell the value of one parameter based on another - assuming they are in the same group.

This saves time in language acquisition, since when learning one parameter, others are automatically acquired as well.

The boy from london ate apples in the kitchen

The boy from London | (ate apples | in the kitchen)

Phrases

Syntactic unit - between the word and the sentence

Phrases consist of two components

* head
* complement(s)

We have several kinds of phrases, classified according to their heads

* verb phrase (vp) - eat apples, drink water, watch a film
* proposition phrases (pp)- in paris, to John, with the teacher
* noun phrases (np)- boys from london, book about linguistics

The existence of these phrases is universal, but the order of the head and the complements need to be acquired per language.

* Parameter: A verb precedes its complement
  
  Value: yes/no

* Parameter: A proposition precedes its complement

  Value: yes/no

Hebreq | English | Japanese
-|-|-
Shote Kafe | Drinks Coffee | koohico nominasm (literally: coffee drinks)

In general, this order is systematic and the head-complement direction is uniform across all phrase types withing a certain language, which again makes acquisition much simpler.

This was a universal *tendency*. There are some languages where the order is mixed, but we will talk about that next time.
