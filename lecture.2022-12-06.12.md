# Linguistics - Lesson 12 - 2022/12/06

### Zero Morphology cont.

Active form (transitive, (פועל יוצא)): $\t{The wind opened the door}$

Passive form (intransitive): $\t{The door was opened}$

Middle (not the actual term) form (intransitive): $\t{The door opened}$

The verb $\t{opened}$ was used as a different verb in the active and middle forms.

This is a form of zero conversion, since the transition from transitive to intransitive forms have no morphological change.

Hebrew:

Active: ha-xom hemis et ha-kerax

Passive: ha-kerax namas

Middle: ha-kerax humas

$\tub{\u{s}akran}{liar}$ - CaCCan

CaCaC - lamad

CiCec - limed

Originally - CiCCeC - limmed

Some patterns allow, for historical or diachronic reasons, additional consonants in the root.

Arabic:

CaCCac - darras - teach

CaCac - daras - study

Hebrew:

We are done with Morphology. We are now moving to Phonetics and Phonology.

### Phonetics and Phonology

These fields deal with linguistic sounds, or phones.

We distinguish between consonants and vowels.

How do we produce sounds?

Air comes from the lungs and we let it out. 

When we produce vowels, the air flows freely. 

In consonants, the airflow is blocked to different degrees. Sometimes it is fully blocked, sometimes blocked in the mouth but air comes out of the nose. 

Phonetics deals with phones in isolation - and studies their features. Phonology deals with phones as part of a system, and how they interact.

mail vs nail

* difference of one phone (n/m)

* difference of meaning

> **definition** Minimal Pair
>
> A pair of words which differ in a single phone and meaning. The single difference in phones is responsible for the change of meaning.

> **definition** phoneme
>
> The minimal linguistic unit that can change meaning.

Take the following words:

symptom symphony - the m in symphony uses the ipa characher $\char"0271$
