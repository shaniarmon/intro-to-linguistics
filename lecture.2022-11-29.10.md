# Linguistics - Lesson 10 - 2022/11/29

Division between inflection and derivation is not always black and white, and the criteria are not always uniform.

Differences between inflection and derivation:

derivation

* New words to our vocabulary
* Enrich our mental lexicon
* sometimes changes lexical category
* Transparency - Applies inconsistently to different words,
  Meaning of derivation is not always clear - $\t{-er}$ 

inflection

* Changes to our grammar
* No change to lexical category
* Clearer productive rules
* Highly transparent output

Hebrew - suffix $\t{-iya}$

xumus - xumusiya

uga - ugiya

guf - gufiya

ir - iriya

$\t{mistreating}$

$\stem{\prefix{mis}\root{treat}}\suffix{ing}$

$\t{-ing}$ - Can be either derivation or inflection

$\t{mis-}$ - derivation

1. Change of meaning
2. Productivity - relatively low.

   $\t{eat}$ - $\t{*miseat}$

3. Transparency - 

   Seems to be relatively consistent regarding meaning

$\t{-ing}$ - inflection

1. Change of grammatical feature - aspect
2. No change of lexical category (Verb)
3. High productivity
3. High transparency

$\t{-ing}$ - derivation

1. Change of lexical category

   Verb -> Noun $\t{Mistreating children is abominable}$

$\t{faithfulness}$

$\stem{\root{faith}\suffix{ful}}\suffix{ness}$

$\t{-ful}$ - Derivation

1. Change of meaning
2. Change of lexical category (Noun -> Adjective)
3. Restricted productivity

   $\t{love}$ -> $\t{*loveful}$

4. relatively restricted tranparency

$\t{ness}$ - Derivation

1. Change of meaning
2. Change of lexical category (Adjective -> Noun)
3. Restricted productivity

   $\t{big}$ -> $\t{*bigness}$

Up until now, we talked about the function of the affixes, and have examined only one method of word formation - affixation.

Affixation is only one strategy to form words, there are others:

### word formation processes/rules/strategies

* Affixation - Take a base and add a prefix/infix/suffix
* Ablaut/Apophany - Change of vowels

  Sing - Song - sung - sang

  hebrew: limed - lamad

  $\tub{ximem}{to warm X}$ - $\tub{hitxamem}{To become warm}$

* Blending - $\t{brunch}$

  Hebrew: $\t{ramzor}$

  $\t{motel}$

* Compounding - $\t{blackboard}$

  * Low compositionality - The meaning is usually idiomatic

> **Definition** Compositionality
>
> The ability to understand the meaning of the whole, by the meaning of its parts,

> **Note** compound vs construct state
> 
> Orech din - Editor of the law - lawyer - compund, idiomatic
> 
> orex iton - editor of a newspaper - construct state, compositional
>
> The meaning of the whole is based on its parts
