# Linguistics - Lesson 4 - 2022/11/08

Innateness - continuation

Unconscious - The knowledge is without actual awareness of grammaticality.

### Process of language acquisition


What about language acquisition, supports the innateness hypothesis?

1. Quick and efficient

   At a very early age, every child (besides for pathological cases) masters the complex systems of language, without and before school.

   The base of language is acquired quickly and efficiently.

2. Spontaneous -> immune to external interference.

   The process happens unplanned. Cannot be completely controlled or fully manipulated.

   When there are attempts to interfere, children often reject corrections and continue as the understood on their own. 

   Eventually grammar fixes itself, but that would happen regardless by age 5-6.

   McNeil (1964)

   Dialogue between a child and their mother.

   "Nobody doesn't like me"

   "No, Say - Nobody likes me"

   "Nobody doesn't like me"

   ... seven times

   "Listen carefully - say nobody likes me"

   "Oh, nobody doesn't like**s** me"

   The child took something from the mothers correction, but not the main point

3. Critical period

   Exposure must happen before a certain age, or they will acquire no mothertongue

4. Poverty of the stimuli

   Exposure on its own is not sufficient to complete the process of acquisition.

   1. Input is **Degenerate** - partial, consists of errors

      Despite this, children fill in and create structures that the did not see before.

      Children can filter the errors and build a grammar despite hearing incomplete sentences, mispronunciation and more.

   2. No teaching - 

   3. No negative evidence

      Some errors are *not* made by children, even though they are nort forwarned not to make them.

      He~1~ thinks John~2|*1~ is smart

      He $\not =$ John

      This error is not performed by children

      John thinks John is smart

5. Identical stages

   Children speaking different grammars, go through the same stages of acquisition

   Null subject

   I ate an apple

   $\boxed{\text{}}$ axalti tapuax
   
   *$\boxed{\text{}}$ ate an apple

   J'ai mange' la pomme - I have eaten the apple

   *ai mange' la pomme

   $\boxed{}$ ho mangiato la mela - $\boxed{}$ have eaten the apple

   Children around the age of two, drop the subject regardless of which language they are learning.

These five feature of language acquisition are supposed to support the innateness hypothosis.
